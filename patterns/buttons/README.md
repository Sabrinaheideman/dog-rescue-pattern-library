The buttons use our accent/secondary color to draw attention and standout against the primary color.

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light color.
- The light buttons are for a dark background.
- The ghost buttons should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image.

Feel free to mix them with the `font-size` classes to make different sizes of buttons.
